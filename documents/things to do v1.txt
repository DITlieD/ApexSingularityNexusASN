what is left to do;  

 * MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)
       * Blueprint Requirement: Use PyTorch and learn2learn for rapid strategy adaptation to new market
         regimes.
       * Current Status: Placeholder.
       * Analysis: The maml_adapter.py script exists, and the necessary libraries are in requirements.txt.
         However, the script is a conceptual template. It does not use the actual GP strategies and contains a
          dummy PyTorch model and a simplified training loop. It is not integrated into the main Forge
         workflow.

   * Advanced Validation (Walk-Forward, Monte Carlo, Causal)
       * Blueprint Requirement: A suite of rigorous validation methods to ensure strategy robustness.
       * Current Status: Placeholder.
       * Analysis: The advanced_validator.py script exists and defines the function signatures for these
         methods. However, the functions themselves contain no logic; they are empty shells. The
         validation_gauntlet.py provides a basic level of validation, but these more advanced techniques are
         not implemented.

   * Intelligent Execution Layer (IEL)
       * Blueprint Requirement: An embedded RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent, packaged as an ONNX file, that
         chooses the best execution tactic (e.g., market vs. limit order).
       * Current Status: Placeholder.
       * Analysis: The Rust infrastructure (iel.rs and its integration in main.rs) is fully implemented and
         can load and run an ONNX model. However, the actual iel_model.onnx file is not a trained RL agent. It
          is a simple, rule-based model that I created to satisfy the technical requirements. The
         "intelligence" is a placeholder.

   * Rigorous HF-ABM Cost Modeling
       * Blueprint Requirement: The simulation must account for fees, spread, slippage, and market impact.
       * Current Status: Partially Implemented.
       * Analysis: Fees and spread crossing are inherent. Slippage has been implemented via the
         slippage_factor. However, a more sophisticated market impact model (how a large trade affects the
         overall market price beyond immediate execution) is not implemented. The current slippage model
         serves as a basic proxy for this.
